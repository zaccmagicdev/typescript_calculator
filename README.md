## First TypeScript App!!
> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).
> <3 Made with love

This is a simple calculator site I made a little bit ago but just finally got to figuring out how to deploy to gh pages using snowpack! This is the first project I have ever made on TS and using it's unique features. TypeScript being strongly typed can be nice to save time on potentially writing more code
and handle more errors. This responsive application features:
- an animated gradient background
- looks great on all devices
- saves entries made on the calculator
- entries can be pulled up on the screen
- keyframes animations for smooth rendering

At some point I may add a page for graphical functions and charts

## I don't wanna open the link to the site. What does it look like?
